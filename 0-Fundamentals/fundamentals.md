## What is Package manager?

- A package manager is a tool that automates the process of installing, updating, configuring, and removing software in a Linux system. It ensures that software and its dependencies are managed efficiently.

## How does it work? 

- A package manager fetches software from official repositories (online storage of packages).
- When you install software, the package manager:  Downloads the package from the repository. Resolves dependencies (installs additional required software). Installs and configures the software automatically.
- A single command updates all installed packages to the latest version.
- The package manager also removes software cleanly without leaving unnecessary files.
